    "# Hotel Booking Optimization\n",
    "Imagine planning holiday for a longer period with stops in multiple location or just a single location but finding out that there is no hotel available for the full length of the stay. In such a situation one is facing the challenge of deciding on a hotel for each location or in the latter scenario booking multiple hotels in a single location. Finding a cost-effective set of hotels is not a straigth forward task since often a plethora of hotels with varying availibility. Travellers find themselves spending a lot of time finding the optimal itinerary. Imagine for example a family that is planning a holiday for a 10-day period and they want to visit three different places. They start by considering to stay tree days in place A, 3 days in place B and four days in place C. Since this exact trajectory may seem pricey they decide to start their holiday with 3 days in place C and visit place A at the end of their journey. Then they start varying the amount of days for each city in search for a more suitable iternary. This could go on forever since there are so many combinations to try and they eventually decide for a combination that seems reasonable.  "

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a trip of length $n_{\\text{days}}^{\\text{total}}$ we assume that a traveller decides to split the full period into a number of periods between $n_{\\text{periods}}^{\\text{min}}$ and $n_{\\text{periods}}^{\\text{max}}$ smaller periods. We furthermore assume that the traveller wants to specify a range of days $n_{\\text{days}}^{\\text{min}}$ to $n_{\\text{days}}^{\\text{max}}$ that the traveller wants to spend at each location. This is important since the optimal sequence of hotels in a mathematical sense might not reflect the travellers perceived optimum. Imagine for example an optimal sequence of 3 hotels whereby the traveller stays each one day at the first two hotels and 13 days in the third hotel. This can of course be the an optimum in terms of price but does not seem like a joyful holiday since the traveller would just be rushing through the first two places and might be bored in city three since so much time is left.\n",

    "- $B = \\{b_{k,i,j} \\in \\{0,1\\}\\} \\text{ is the availability which evaluates to 1 if hotel $k$ is available during the days $i$ and $j$.}$\n",
    "- $X_\\text{free} = \\{x_{k,i,j}: b_{k,i,j} = 1, n_{\\text{days}}^{\\text{min}} \\le i-j \\le n_{\\text{days}}^{\\text{max}}\\}  \\text{ is the set of all $x_{k,i,j}$ where hotel $k$ is actually availible and the timeframe satisfies the travellers specified range.}$\n",

The original dataset can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djusdjus/hotel-rooms-prices-dataset and consists of 120 rows of hotel accomodation data from www.booking.com. The most important columns in the data are the `Hotel name` , `Price(BAM)`and `Rooms`. A combination of `Hotel name` and `Rooms`will be considered a hotel room type corresponding to a unique index $i$ as defined above. Similarly does `Price (BAM)`correspond to $r_i$ the daily rate for a particular room."
